      <p>At work I find myself wearing a bunch of different hats (both metaphorically and literally). As I sit right in-between product and engineering, I tend to find myself advocating for the people using the software, whilst also helping businesses find validity.</p>
      <p>Over the years I have slowly refined my process. It usually consists of creating highly detailed prototypes, iterating and mostly importantly, shipping. My goal thought, is to find a simple solution for the complex problems that often arise.</p>
      <p>My current tool of choice is Figma, but from time to time I'll hop in code and use real data to get a good feel for the interface. If you are working on a gnarly problem, drop me an email and let's solve it.</p>
